        <!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">Robotics without border is an independent initiative targetted to making engineering design of robotics 
            consider the humanitarian aspect/impact/infleunce of robots on humans, living and the Earth. 
            Unlike HRI conferences and Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics", this initiative is addressed 
            to the immediate needs of the changes in the way to think. We address day-to-day issues arising/addressed 
            and impact(positive/negative) generated among 'common' people because of our (un/)thoughful designs. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"> I , Aria, entered in the field of robotics because it was super cool, 
            finding implementable solutions to manual problems and because automation was a sign of progress.
            Any new gadget in the house was a sign of our prosperity(in India). 
            The more functions a robot can do flawless, the more awesome it is. 
            At some point I started focusing only on the coolness of the robot, 
            rather than solving the core problem at hand. I would make cool animations 
            with LEDs rather than asking railway workers if my automation is useful for them. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Education on ethics and philosophy during bachelors or masters never attracted me. 
           I saw the courses as liabality and would rather do space robotics.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">My bubble bursted soon enough, after I recieved my masters degree. 
            With the endless programming, research and fitting into the system, 
            I earned this piece of paper, from one of the globally presitigious universities, 
            yay me! --- but-----for what? 
            now what?
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">I was having an identity crisis at 24. huh!?</p>


        <p style="text-align: justify;">I had discussions with my professors, browsed posters on university walls, 
            write my thoughts, had conversations with my nerd and amazingly smart fellows.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Unable to find answers. I started attending networking events, workshops, 
            seminars and workshops outside the industry. I did not understand!
            I did not understand most of what was said, but also who is really doing the 'good' work?        
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">It felt that social sceintists, policy makers and NGOs seem to be doing it.
            But they looked up in admiration to my education, and saw me as an highly regarded intellectual.
            But I just make patterns in LED matrix do cool things or make my own PC. 
            It is cool, but it is not fixing hunger ...
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">This intitiative and framework on this website stems from my need to find a purpose
            in the robots I create. In the past 5 years I navigated a variety of domains, 
            to work in technical projects that make a difference. In this website you will find ample of 
            material, examples and ways in which we can make our world a better place with our
            engineering skills.
